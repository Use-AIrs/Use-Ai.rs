# [Use AI](https://github.com/Use-AIrs/Use-Ai.rs/tree/main/crates/use-ai)

### Current
*Use-AI* is just a basic cli tool written with [Inquire](https://github.com/mikaelmello/inquire). Inquire is used since
we just want to have a nice little entry point for People who doesn't now the project and want to find out what with data
can be done with *Use-AI.rs*. Also, Inquire provides an interface which allows you to easily find the underlying functions
so you have an example of how *Use-AI.rs* can be used in production.

### Future
The *Use-AI* Tool is just the first tool we want to provide. In Future the goal is to provide a hole Network Server Layer.
For the Server layer we are thinking about a TCP Server. The Server should provide a load test tool for a hypothetical
Query Server. But since this is a plan in far future these are only idea's. When someone I found who can implement something
like that it may be implemented in parallel.
