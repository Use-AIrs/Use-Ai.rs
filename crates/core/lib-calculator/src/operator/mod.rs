//! For an Operation we first need to build an Operator.
//! A push takes some values in one form or another and builds an Operator with these.
//! When some primitive data is pushed/build into an Operator we can execute the Operator.
//! The OperationResult can the ether be finalized or can be pushed again to build more complex operations.
//! For now, we just implement everything with pushes on the Cpu. But our approach will allow us to
//! lower this mechanism completely into a Gpu kernel when introducing a counter and an allocator.
