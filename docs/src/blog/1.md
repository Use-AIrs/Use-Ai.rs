# Use AI Tool Demo | 14.01.2025

With today’s update, the **Use-AI.rs** tool is introduced! To get started, you need to have **Rust** installed and a **MongoDB** instance running at `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/`.

You can target other domains by modifying the connection string in [`mangodb.rs`](https://github.com/Use-AIrs/use-ai.rs/blob/main/crates/core/lib-store/src/mangodb.rs). While this approach is not ideal and will be improved in the future, it demonstrates the current design concept adequately for now.

To begin, navigate to `crates/use-ai` in your terminal. Here, you can run the exploration tool for **Use-AI.rs**.

### Steps to Get Started:
1. Open the **Config** menu.
2. Select **Import** and provide the following:
    - **Path**: The path to the example configuration file [`config_GBDT_example.json`](https://github.com/Use-AIrs/use-ai.rs/blob/main/config_GBDT_example.json).
    - **Name**: A name for the imported configuration.
3. After importing, load the imported configuration for use in the **Start** menu.
4. Navigate to the **Start** menu.
5. Select **Init Transformation** to transform the provided `test.csv`.

### Output:
The terminal will display a table representation of the transformed data, which is ready for downstream processing by the Operator.
- **Header Mapping**: The headers are mapped appropriately.
- **String Records**: Non-numerical string records are mapped to their numerical representation in the data.

At this stage, the transformation demonstrates the data flow up to the lowest abstraction layer (**Operator**), which is not yet fully implemented.


## Future Plans

The next milestone in building the first complete data pipeline for Use-AI.rs is the development of a GPU-optimized GBDT algorithm for the Operator with Burn.


## Disclaimer

Today’s update introduces the first major structural decision for the project.  
While the crate setup will remain as it is, individual functions and types may be reorganized in future iterations. However, all components will continue to follow a similar structural approach to what exists now.
