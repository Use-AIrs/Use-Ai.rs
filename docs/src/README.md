At Use-AI.rs, we are building an open-source AI framework in Rust.
Our goal is to create a concurrent, locally hostable AI agent for practical applications in production environments.

To achieve this goal, we are building on top of Burn and CubeCL.
We are working with a JSON configuration standard. This configuration file contains all the information required to transform data and execute various AI operations. CubeCL provides us with the necessary operational tools to achieve our aim of delivering a practical AI framework.

For production coding, we will focus on implementing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks. Additionally, we plan to implement ensemble learning algorithms. In the first iteration, we will use gradient-based decision trees (GBDT).
