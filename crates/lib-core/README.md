#### Core

Welcome to the **Core**. Here we have every operation needed for the staging API. When you want to integrate Use-AI.rs
to your async program this is the lib you will need. In here we transform, train and use our data.
The Operator is for data transformation to prepare each stage properly.
Store is for saving between each operational stage.
Finally, the Calculator is for Mathematical execute with potentially different targets. So we will build on top
of [Burn](https://burn.dev/) here.
