## Operator

Here the AI Magic will happen. Starting with [Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) we will take arguments from the model part of configs to initialize an "AI". For now, we aim to implement features based on the implementations given by Burn. In future iterations we want to build optimized GPU kernels from a config with [CubeCL](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl).
